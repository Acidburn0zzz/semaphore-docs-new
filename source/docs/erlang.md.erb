Semaphore supports Erlang through [kerl](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl), which
enables you to install different versions and switch between them.

Our stack comes with Erlang version <%= package_version("erlang") %>.

List of all packages and versions is available on the
[supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
