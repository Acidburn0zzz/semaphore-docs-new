category: The Semaphore platform

Semaphore fully supports using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) in a
continuous delivery process. Docker's container technology can be used in
various use cases. You can learn more about these use cases in the official
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com).

To start using Docker tools, switch your Semaphore project to using the Docker
platform under `Project Settings > Platform`.

Semaphore's Docker platform has Docker <%= package_version("docker") %>, [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/)
 <%= package_version("docker-machine") %>, and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) <%= package_version("docker-compose") %> pre-installed, so
you'll be ready to use the Docker [CLI](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/)
once you've made the switch in your build commands.

To avoid permission problems when using the Docker CLI, commands should be used
with `sudo`.
