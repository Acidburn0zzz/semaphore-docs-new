title: Ruby support on Semaphore
category: Ruby

Semaphore has the following Ruby versions available via [<%= package_name("rbenv") %>](<%= package_url("rbenv") %>):

<% package_versions("ruby").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

The Semaphore stack includes:

- [<%= package_name("bundler") %>](<%= package_url("bundler") %>) (<%= package_version("bundler") %>)
- [<%= package_name("rubygems") %>](<%= package_url("rubygems") %>) (<%= package_version("rubygems") %>)

List of all packages and versions is available on the [supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.

### Ruby version

The version specified in project settings will be set as global before your build commands run. Semaphore uses [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for managing Ruby versions.

Setting Ruby version is performed by the equivalent of the following commands:

    rm -f .rbenv-version .ruby-version
    rbenv global 2.0.0-p451

### Installing additional version of Ruby

In case your application requires specific Ruby version which is not available by default in Semaphore VM you can install it via rbenv. It's simple. You would only need to add few lines to your [build commands](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html) like in example below:

```bash
cd ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build && git pull && cd $SEMAPHORE_PROJECT_DIR
rbenv install 2.1.0-preview1
rbenv local 2.1.0-preview1
gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
# followed by your build commands
```
