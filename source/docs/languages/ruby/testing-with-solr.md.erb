title: Testing Ruby/Rails applications that use Solr
category: Ruby
---

To run tests which depend on Solr, we recommend using [Sunspot::Solr](https://rubygems.org/gems/sunspot_solr)
that bundles Solr distribution for use with Sunsport.

Before running tests, Solr needs to be manually started with the build command:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
```

The command should execute after database is created, but before any test runs.
