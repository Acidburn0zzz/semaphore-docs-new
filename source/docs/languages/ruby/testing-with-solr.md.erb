title: Testing Ruby/Rails applications that use Solr
category: Ruby

Semaphore has Solr pre-installed, running on the default port 8981.

Before running tests, Solr needs to be manually started with the build command:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
```

The command should execute after database is created, but before any test runs.
