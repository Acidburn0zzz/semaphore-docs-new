title: Switching Ruby version on a specific branch
category: Ruby

Add a new [build command](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html) that will set the Ruby version:

```bash
if [ "$BRANCH_NAME" = "ruby-2" ]; then rbenv local 2.0.0-p247 ; fi
```

Current package versions are listed on the [Supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
