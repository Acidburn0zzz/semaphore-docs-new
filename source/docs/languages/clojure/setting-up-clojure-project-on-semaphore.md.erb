title: Setting up a Clojure project on Semaphore
category: Clojure
---

To add your Clojure project on Semaphore, first you’ll need to create an account.
After that you will be able to add a new project from GitHub, right from your
dashboard.

After you've selected a branch to build and a brief repository analysis,
Semaphore will automatically configure your project for testing.  For example,
if your project contains a `project.clj` file in its root directory,
Semaphore will assume that it’s written in Clojure and propose commands to
install dependencies and run your tests.

Most projects will only need to run `lein test` as their build command.
The dependencies will be automatically pulled the first time and
[cached](/docs/caching-between-builds.html) for later reuse.

Leiningen is the project and build management tool for Clojure. See
[its homepage](http://leiningen.org) for more information on how to use it.
