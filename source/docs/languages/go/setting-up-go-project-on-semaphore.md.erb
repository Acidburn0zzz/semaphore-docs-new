title: Setting up a Go project on Semaphore
category: Go
---

Adding your Go project requires you to have a Semaphore account already created.
The project can be added from either GitHub or Bitbucket, right from your
Semaphore dashboard.

After you've selected the branch you want to build, Semaphore will briefly
analyze the project and propose some build commands and settings, which you can
modify if needed, to better fit your setup.
