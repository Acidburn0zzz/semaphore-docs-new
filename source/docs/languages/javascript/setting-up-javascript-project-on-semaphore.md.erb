title: Setting up a JavaScript project on Semaphore
category: JavaScript
---

To add your JavaScript project on Semaphore, first you’ll need to create an account.
After that you will be able to add a new project from GitHub, right from your
dashboard.

After you've selected a branch to build and a brief repository analysis,
Semaphore will automatically configure your project for testing.

For example, after analyzing Grunt project, Semaphore will assume that it’s
written in JavaScript and propose commands to install dependencies and run tests.
