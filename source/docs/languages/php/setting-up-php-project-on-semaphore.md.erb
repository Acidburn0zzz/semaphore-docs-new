title: Setting up a PHP project on Semaphore
category: PHP
---

To add your PHP project on Semaphore, first you’ll need to create an account.
After that you will be able to add a new project from GitHub, right from your
dashboard.

After you've selected a branch to build and a brief repository analysis,
Semaphore will automatically configure your project for testing.  For example,
if your project contains a `composer.json` file in its root directory,
Semaphore will assume that it’s written in PHP and propose commands to
install dependencies and run your tests.
