title: PHP support on Semaphore
category: PHP
---

Semaphore supports the following PHP versions via
[<%= package_name("phpbrew") %>](<%= package_url("phpbrew") %>):

<% package_versions("php").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

The Semaphore stack includes:

- [<%= package_name("composer") %>](<%= package_url("composer") %>)
- [<%= package_name("pear") %>](<%= package_url("pear") %>)
- [<%= package_name("pecl") %>](<%= package_url("pecl") %>)
- [<%= package_name("phpunit") %>](<%= package_url("phpunit") %>) (<%= package_version("phpunit") %>)

List of all packages and versions is available on the
[supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.

## PHP versions

The major version specified in project settings will be set as global to the
latest corresponding version. Semaphore uses
[<%= package_name("phpbrew") %>](<%= package_url("phpbrew") %>) for managing
PHP versions.

Setting a PHP version is performed by the equivalent of the following command:

    phpbrew switch php-7.0

## Modifying the PHP configuration file

For simple changes like setting a different timezone you can use a build command
like below which changes the timezone from `UTC` to `America/Denver`. We're using
`|` as a delimiter in `sed` to avoid escaping the forward slash in the timezone.

    phpbrew cd etc && sed -i "s|date.timezone = UTC|date.timezone = 'America/Denver'|" php.ini && cd -

You can also use your custom `php.ini` file. Include the configuration file in
Project Settings > Configuration Files and add the line below as a build command.
In this case, the configuration file is called `custom_php.ini`.

    phpbrew cd etc && cp /home/runner/custom_php.ini php.ini && cd -
