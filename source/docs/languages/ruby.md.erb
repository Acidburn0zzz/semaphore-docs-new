### Setting up a Ruby project on Semaphore

To add your Ruby project on Semaphore, first youâ€™ll need to create an account.
After that you will be able to add a new project from GitHub, right from your
dashboard.

After you've selected a branch to build and a brief repository analysis,
Semaphore will automatically configure your project for testing.  For example,
after analyzing a project that's using RSpec and Cucumber, Semaphore will
propose commands for running RSpec and Cucumber tests:

### Semaphore stack

Semaphore has the following Ruby versions available via [<%= package_name("rbenv") %>](<%= package_url("rbenv") %>):

<% package_versions("ruby").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

The Semaphore stack includes:

- [<%= package_name("bundler") %>](<%= package_url("bundler") %>) (<%= package_version("bundler") %>)
- [<%= package_name("rubygems") %>](<%= package_url("rubygems") %>) (<%= package_version("rubygems") %>)

List of all packages and versions is available on the [supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.

### Ruby version

The version specified in project settings will be set as global before your build commands run. Semaphore uses [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for managing Ruby versions. 

Setting Ruby version is performed by the equivalent of the following commands:

    rm -f .rbenv-version .ruby-version
    rbenv global 2.0.0-p451

### Installing additional version of Ruby

In case your application requires specific Ruby version which is not available by default in Semaphore VM you can install it via rbenv. It's simple. You would only need to add few lines to your [build commands](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html) like in example below:

```bash
rbenv install 2.1.0-preview1
rbenv local 2.1.0-preview1
gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
# followed by your build commands
```

### Switching Ruby version on a specific branch

Add a new [build command](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html) that will set the Ruby version:

```bash
if [ "$BRANCH_NAME" = "ruby-2" ]; then rbenv local 2.0.0-p247 ; fi
```

Current package versions are listed on the [Supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.

### Using database from a Ruby application

In case a database engine in selected in project settings, Semaphore will generate a file `config/database.yml` with working [database access](/docs/database-access.html) credentials.

For Rails apps, project analysis also generates `bundle exec rake db:setup` and `bundle exec rake db:test:prepare` into your build commands, which is enough for things to just work in most cases.

Semaphore does not create the database before your build begins. It is up to your build commands to do so.
