The Semaphore stack includes:

- <%= package_name("java") %> (<%= package_version("java") %>)
- [<%= package_name("leiningen") %>](<%= package_url("leiningen") %>) (<%= package_version("leiningen") %>)

List of all packages and versions is available on the [supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.

Leiningen is the project and build management tool for Clojure. See [its homepage](http://leiningen.org) for more information on how to use it.

Most projects will only need to run `lein test` as their build command. The dependencies will be automatically pulled the first time and [cached](/docs/caching-between-builds.html) for later reuse.
