### Setting up a Clojure project on Semaphore

To add your Clojure project on Semaphore, first you’ll need to create an account.
After that you will be able to add a new project from GitHub, right from your
dashboard.

After you've selected a branch to build and a brief repository analysis,
Semaphore will automatically configure your project for testing.  For example,
if your project contains a `project.clj` file in its root directory,
Semaphore will assume that it’s written in Clojure and propose commands to
install dependencies and run your tests.

Most projects will only need to run `lein test` as their build command.
The dependencies will be automatically pulled the first time and
[cached](/docs/caching-between-builds.html) for later reuse.

Leiningen is the project and build management tool for Clojure. See
[its homepage](http://leiningen.org) for more information on how to use it.

### Semaphore stack

The Semaphore stack includes:

- <%= package_name("java") %> (<%= package_version("java") %>)
- [<%= package_name("leiningen") %>](<%= package_url("leiningen") %>)
(<%= package_version("leiningen") %>)

List of all packages and versions is available on the
[supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
