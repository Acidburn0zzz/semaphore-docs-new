category: The Semaphore platform

Every build and deploy on Semaphore runs in a lightweight, isolated virtual
machine based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit. This page describes the software
provided in these VMs.

The timezone in the virtual machine is set to UTC. To find out how to change
this value visit [this page](/docs/how-to-change-timezone.html).

### <a name="language-support" href="#language-support">Language support</a>

Semaphore provides first-class support for the following programming languages:

- [C/C++](/docs/c-continuous-integration.html)
- [Clojure](/docs/clojure-continuous-integration.html)
- [Elixir](/docs/elixir-continuous-integration.html)
- [Go](/docs/go-continuous-integration.html)
- [Java](/docs/java-continuous-integration.html)
- [JavaScript](/docs/javascript-continuous-integration.html), via Node.js
- [PHP](/docs/php-continuous-integration.html)
- [Python](/docs/python-continuous-integration.html)
- [Ruby](/docs/ruby-continuous-integration.html)
- [Scala](/docs/scala-continuous-integration.html)

Note that applications in any programming language can be configured manually
in [project settings](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html).
If you would like a language which is not listed above to be supported
out of the box, please [send us email](mailto:support@semaphoreci.com) or
[install it manually](/docs/how-to-install-dependency.html).

Besides using the language which is selected in the project settings,
you can utilize any combination of languages and versions
from the table bellow. For example, to use Node.js `5.6.0`
with a project which is not configured as such, add a following line as a
[setup command](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html).

```bash
nvm use 5.6.0
```

To find more information about managing different language versions
on Semaphore, please refer to the corresponding [language page](/docs).

__Note:__ this is a partial list. You can upgrade or add additional packages for your builds with [apt-get](/docs/how-to-install-dependency.html) - either from Ubuntu's [official distribution channels](http://packages.ubuntu.com) or third-party PPAs.

We have a number of open source [test apps](/docs/test-apps.html) in various flavors that we use for verification. If your setup is different or you're having problems making your build pass, we encourage you to [contact us](mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com) - we'd be happy to get your app building on Semaphore as quickly as possible.
