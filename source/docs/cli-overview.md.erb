The Semaphore Command Line Interface (CLI), is a tool for creating and managing
Semaphore projects from the command line / shell of various operating systems.
It is built with Ruby and the code is [open sourced](https://github.com/renderedtext/cli).

If you have any problems or requests please contact [support](https://semaphoreci.com/support),
or [open an issue in the CLI repository on GitHub](https://github.com/renderedtext/cli/issues).

### Prerequisites and installation

The Semaphore CLI requires Ruby >= 2.0 to run.

Verify that you have an up to date Ruby on your system before installation:

``` bash
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16 revision 53162) [universal.x86_64-darwin16]
```

The Semaphore CLI is installed as a gem. Run the following command to install
the CLI:

``` bash
$ gem install sem
```

Verify that the installation succeded:

``` bash
$ sem version
0.6.2
```

### Authentication

To manage resources on Sempahore, you need to log in to Semaphore from the
command line:

``` bash
$ sem login --auth-token <your-auth-token>
```

You can find your authentication token on the bottom of
[your user edit page](https://semaphoreci.com/users/edit).

To log out, run the following:

``` bash
$ sem logout
```

### Using the CLI



### Troubleshooting

The Semaphore CLI can display all the API requests that can help with identifying
issues. This mode is called _trace_ mode.

To run the CLI in trace mode, pass the `--trace` flag to the CLI:

``` bash
$ sem orgs:list --trace
