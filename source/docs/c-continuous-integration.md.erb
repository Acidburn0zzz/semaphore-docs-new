You can test and integrate C/C++ programs on Semaphore using the preinstalled
build tools such as gcc, g++ and Make. You can also leverage
[caching between builds](/docs/caching-between-builds.html) by copying relevant
assets to the `.semaphore-cache` directory.

The Semaphore stack includes:

- [<%= package_name("gcc") %>](<%= package_url("gcc") %>)
(<%= package_version("gcc") %>)

The list of all packages and versions is available on the
[supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
