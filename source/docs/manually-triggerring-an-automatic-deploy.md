After you create your server, you can easily launch a deploy manually from a build page.

Launch a deploy manually by choosing a target server that you wish to deploy to and then deploy. You can also edit your deploy
release message to something more descriptive.

You can edit your deploy message by clicking on it. After you've done typing your message, click Save. Now
you and your team members can read a more descriptive message about what you deployed.
