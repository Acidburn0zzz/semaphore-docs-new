Our feature, Activity Monitor allows you to get a bigger picture across all
projects within your organization by allowing you to see all current and upcoming
CI/CD processes that are currently running on Semaphore: builds, deploys, and
active SSH sessions. This way you are able to track your current work's place in
the grand scheme of CI processing order.

Since Activity Monitor is most useful when your work is partially blocked by other
processes, you will see the link to it on pages of affected builds and branches.
You can also always access Activity Monitor from the left sidebar on your
organization's profile page.

Also, Activity Monitor allows you to see the number of occupied boxes at any given
moment. 

__Note:__
This feature is available for paid organizations only.
