All API access is over HTTPS. Every method requires the user to provide their authentication token via `auth_token` parameter.

To see your authentication token, open your Account page (in the top navigation
bar). The token is located at the bottom of the screen.

To see a particular project's hash ID, open the project’s settings, then find the “Admin” tab.
