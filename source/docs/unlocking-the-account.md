In the top right corner of your Semaphore CI homepage you will find "Log in" button.
If, by any reason, you enter wrong password 5 times in a row, your account will
be locked due to an excessive number of unsuccessful log in attempts. In order
to unlock the acc, you should check your email. There you will find link for
unlocking the account.

 __Note:__
If youâ€™re still not sure about your old password, we suggest that you change it
right after unlocking the account.
