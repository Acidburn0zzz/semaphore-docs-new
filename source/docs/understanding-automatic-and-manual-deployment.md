There are two deployment strategies on Semaphore: "automatic" and "manual".

**Automatic** means that a deploy will be triggered after every passed build on
the selected branch. Besides that, you can also manually deploy any build from
any branch at any time.

**Manual** strategy requires manual selection of builds to deploy.

For automatic deployment you will be asked to select which branch will be
automatically deployed after each passed build.

You can easily change the deployment strategy from server settings at any time
after the setup is complete.
