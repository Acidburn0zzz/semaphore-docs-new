Semaphore provides Erlang through [kerl](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl), which
enables you to install different versions and switch between them.

Our stack comes with Erlang versions:

<% package_versions("erlang").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

List of all packages and versions is available on the
[supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
