Setting up a continuous integration process for PHP is easy on Semaphore, with
all major tools and extensions being preinstalled and ready to use in the build
environment. When you add a PHP project on Semaphore, it will analyze its code
and propose a set of build commands to test the project. Often no more setup is required to enjoy the full power of continuous integration. Your project
dependencies are also automatically cached and reused across builds.
