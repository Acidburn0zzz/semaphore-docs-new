Default timezone in the virtual machine is set to UTC. In order to customize its value,
add an [environment variable](/docs/exporting-environment-variables.html) called `TZ`
with a value from this [table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
For example:

```
TZ=America/Los_Angeles
```

List of the available environment variables in the VMs can be found on [this page](/docs/available-environment-variables.html).
