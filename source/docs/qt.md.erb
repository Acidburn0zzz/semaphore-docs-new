Semaphore supports the following versions of the Qt runtime:

<% package_versions("qt").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Switching between Qt versions is done through creating an environment variable
called `QT_SELECT`.

The value of this variable can be set to:

  - `5` or `qt5` to select version <%= package_versions("qt").last %>
  - `4` or `qt4` to select version <%= package_versions("qt").first %>

The default version is <%= package_versions("qt").first %>.

If you use the `capybara-webkit` gem and decide to change the version of Qt, the
gem has to be reinstalled. One way to achieve this, is by expiring your project's
cache in Project Settings. On the other hand, if you'd like to preserve your
cache, please send your request to our support.
