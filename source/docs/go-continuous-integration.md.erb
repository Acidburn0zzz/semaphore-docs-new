Setting up a Go project on Semaphore is easy. The first time you add a Go
project, Semaphore will analyze it and propose some frequently used build
commands to speed up the setup process. If needed, these commands can be
[customized](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html) to better suit your needs.

## CI environment for Go projects

The [Semaphore platform](/docs/supported-stack.html) supports Go version <%= package_version("go") %>.

The `$GOPATH` environment variable is set to `/home/runner/workspace` which
contains the `bin`, `pkg` and `src` folders.

Your project's root directory is represented with a symlink in the `src` folder
of `$GOPATH`.

## Dependency management

Go project by default are configured to run:

```
go get -v -d ./… && go build -v ./…
```

The three dots (`...`) Go wildcard is used to expand to all package directories
found in `$GOPATH`.

To achieve faster build times, we recommend caching your project's dependencies
with [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep#install).
