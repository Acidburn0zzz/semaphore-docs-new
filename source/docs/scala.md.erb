Semaphore makes it easy to add Scala projects with [Java](/docs/java.html)
preinstalled. The first time you add a Scala project, Semaphore will analyze it
and suggest to run the tests with the current Scala version and `sbt`.

After the analysis determintes that the project is written in Scala, the
following command is suggested.

```bash
sbt ++$SEMAPHORE_SCALA_VERSION test
```

## CI environment for Scala projects

The [Semaphore platform](/docs/supported-stack.html) supports Scala version
<%= package_version("scala") %>. Version <%= package_version("sbt") %> of the
[sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) build tool is pre-installed. The current
version of Scala is also avaliable through the `SEMAPHORE_SCALA_VERSION`
environment variable.

## Dependency management

Cached resolution is added to `sbt` as an [experimental feature]
(http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Cached-Resolution.html#Cached+resolution)
starting with version `0.13.7`. If you use this feature, the contents of
`~/.sbt/0.13/dependency/` is [cached between builds](/docs/caching-between-builds.html).
