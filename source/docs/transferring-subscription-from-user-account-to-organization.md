Semaphore doesn't support transferring subscription from a personal (user) account to an organization. 
If you currently own a paid personal plan on Semaphore (Solo, Starter or Double) and would like to migrate to an organization, you should first [set up an organization](/docs/organizations/setting-up-an-organization.html). 
If this is your first organization, a free 30-day trial will be started during which you'll have opportunity to run up to 8 parallel jobs. 
If you'd like to transfer your current projects from your user account to newly formed organization, please refer to [this doc](/docs/organizations/transferring-a-project-to-an-organization.html). 

Once you have all your projects up and running and you're ready to proceed with ordering a subscription for your organization, you should follow these steps:

1. Click on your profile photo and from the drop-down menu choose the organization you’d like to purchase a subscription for,
2. On the left side of your organization page click on “Subscription”,
3. Choose the right subscription for your organization and you’ll be redirected to the Semaphore CI Store where you’ll be able to asked to enter payment information.

Also, you should cancel subscription for your user account by following these steps:

1. Click on your profile photo and choose "Subscription",
2. In the bottom right corner you'll find "Cancel subscription" button/link,
3. You’ll be redirected to the Semaphore CI store where you'll need to click on "Cancel subscription" in order to complete the process.
