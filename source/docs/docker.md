category: The Semaphore platform
---

Semaphore currently offers [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) support in a beta
platform. If you wan't to use this platform for your projects, contact us on
[support](mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com) with your request. After we approve your
account for the beta, you can switch to this platform in
`Project Settings > Platform`.

The beta platform has Docker pre-installed, so once you make the switch, you're
ready to use the Docker [CLI](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/)
in your build commands.

To avoid permission problems when using the Docker CLI, commands should be used
with `sudo`.
