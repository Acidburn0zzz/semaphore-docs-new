### Boosters for Cucumber

#### Supported versions

Test Boosters currently supports following Cucumber versions:
...

#### How do Boosters run your Cucumber scenarios

Boosters CLI runs your Cucumber scenarios using `cucumber_booster` command:
```
cucumber_booster --job <job>/<job_count>
```
This command uses `~/cucumber_split_configuration.json` file in order to
look for your job's split configuration.

Assuming that you have following split configuration located at the $HOME
directory:
```
[
  { "files": ["features/feature_1.feature", "features/feature_2.feature"] },
  { "files": ["features/feature_3.feature", "features/feature_4.feature"] },
  { "files": ["features/feature_5.feature", "features/feature_6.feature"] }
]
```

And you run your features with `cucumber_booster` command:
```
cucumber_booster --job 1/3
```

Under the hood, Boosters command invokes Cucumber with the following
command:
```
bundle exec cucumber features/feature_1.feature features/feature_2.feature
```

At the end of the chain, you have Cucumber run your features.

#### Customize Cucumber configuration used by Boosters

You can customize Cucumber configuration by introducing additional
[profiles](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/cucumber.yml)
within your `cucumber.yml` file. Only make sure you append them
to the default one since Test Boosters run Cucumber like following:
```
bundle exec cucumber <file_list>
```

Test Boosters create separate `semaphoreci` profile within your `cucumber.yml` configuration,
and appends it to the default one. This way your custom defined configuration
stays unmodified. This is handled by our
[semaphore_cucumber_booster_config](https://github.com/renderedtext/cucumber_booster_config) gem which is open sourced.
