### Supported versions

Test Boosters supports all Cucumber versions starting <nobr>from `2.0.0-rc.1`</nobr> and conclusive <nobr>with `3.0.2`</nobr>.

### How Boosters run your Cucumber scenarios

Boosters CLI runs your scenarios using `cucumber_booster` command:

```
cucumber_booster --job <job>/<job_count>
```

This command uses `~/cucumber_split_configuration.json` file in order to
look for job's configuration.

Let's assume you have the following split configuration:

```
[
  { "files": ["features/f_1.feature", "features/f_2.feature"] },
  { "files": ["features/f_3.feature", "features/f_4.feature"] },
  { "files": ["features/f_5.feature", "features/f_6.feature"] }
]
```

And you run your features with `cucumber_booster` command:

```
cucumber_booster --job 1/3
```

Under the hood Boosters invoke Cucumber using the following
command:

```
bundle exec cucumber features/f_1.feature features/f_2.feature
```

At the end of the chain, you have Cucumber run your features.

### Customize Cucumber configuration used by Boosters

You can customize Cucumber configuration by introducing additional
[profiles](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/cucumber.yml)
within your `cucumber.yml` file.

Make sure you append them
to the default one since Boosters only run default profile:

```
bundle exec cucumber <file_list>
```

Boosters create separate `semaphoreci` profile within your `cucumber.yml` configuration,
and appends it to the default one. This way your custom defined configuration
stays unmodified. It is handled by our Open Source
[`semaphore_cucumber_booster_config`](https://github.com/renderedtext/cucumber_booster_config) gem.

If you notice any unexpected behaviour in your test suite with Boosters, we encourage you to create a support ticket. Though if you think you've found a bug in Boosters gem, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/renderedtext/test-boosters/issues/new) on GitHub.
