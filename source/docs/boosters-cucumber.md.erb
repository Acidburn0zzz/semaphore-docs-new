### Supported versions

Boosters officially support Cucumber versions starting <nobr>from `2.0.0-rc.1`</nobr> conclusive <nobr>with `3.0.2`</nobr>.

Boosters may also work with some older versions though we don't make any guarantees. If you encounter an issue when using Boosters with a Cucumber version older then `2.0.0-rc.1`, we encourage you to [contact our support team](https://semaphoreci.com/support).

### How Boosters run your Cucumber scenarios

Test Boosters gem runs your scenarios with `cucumber_booster` command:

```
cucumber_booster --job <job>/<job_count>
```

The command uses split configuration file in order to
find the configuration of a job to be run. This file contains distribution of your test files across many jobs. Split configurations for your jobs are located in `~/cucumber_split_cofiguration.json` file. Semaphore provides this file to each of the Boosted jobs.

Let's assume to have the following split configuration within `~/cucumber_split_configuration.json`:

```
[
  { "files": ["features/f_1.feature", "features/f_2.feature"] },
  { "files": ["features/f_3.feature", "features/f_4.feature"] },
  { "files": ["features/f_5.feature", "features/f_6.feature"] }
]
```

And features are run using the `cucumber_booster` command:

```
cucumber_booster --job 1/3
```

Under the hood Boosters invoke Cucumber using the following
command:

```
bundle exec cucumber features/f_1.feature features/f_2.feature
```

As previously shown, Booster for Cucumber builds and runs Cucumber command which output is formatted as json and redirected to `~/rspec_report.json` file.

The report file created contains durations of your test files. It is used to estimate duration for each job in the next build.

### Customize Cucumber configuration used by Boosters

To customize Cucumber configuration, you are able to introduce additional
[profiles](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/cucumber.yml)
within your `cucumber.yml` file.

Make sure you append these
to the default one, since Boosters only run the default profile:

```
bundle exec cucumber <file_list>
```

Boosters create separate `semaphoreci` profile within your `cucumber.yml` configuration,
and appends it to the default one. This way your custom defined configuration
stays unmodified. It is handled by our Open Source
[`semaphore_cucumber_booster_config`](https://github.com/renderedtext/cucumber_booster_config) gem.

If you notice any unexpected behaviour in your test suite with Boosters, we encourage you to create a support ticket. Though if you think you've found a bug in Boosters gem, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/renderedtext/test-boosters/issues/new) on GitHub.
