title: How to update Chrome on Semaphore?
category: Build troubleshooting
---

If your developement process depends on the latest Chrome version which is not pre-installed on Semaphore,
you can install it by adding the following commands to the setup of the build:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome-source.list

install-package --update-new google-chrome-stable
```

These commands [cache](/docs/caching-between-builds.html) installations from APT with our `install-package` tool.
To get more detailed informations about its options,
refer to [this](/docs/how-to-install-dependency.html#caching-installations) page.

Software updates on Semaphore are provided with [regular platform updates](/docs/platform-updates.html).
Also, every platform update comes with updated and compatible versions of ChromeDriver and Google Chrome stable.

Semaphore currently supports Chrome <%= package_version("chrome") %>
and ChromeDriver <%= package_version("chromedriver") %>.

# Common issues

`chromedriver-helper` gem is often configured to use
the [latest available version of ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). 
This can lead to an incompatibility issue (shown below), 
indicating that the pre-installed Google Chrome version isn't supported.

```bash
session not created exception: Chrome version must be >= 65.0.3325.0 
(Driver info: chromedriver=2.38.551591 (bcc4a2cdef0f6b942b2bb8049068f65340fa2a69)
```

In this case, the `chromedriver-helper` gem overrides the pre-installed version,
and the latest version is used instead of the included one.

Besides updating Google Chrome, you can also [configure](https://github.com/flavorjones/chromedriver-helper#specifying-a-version) `chromedriver-helper` gem to use a compatible ChromeDriver version (<%= package_version("chromedriver") %>)

For the fastest feedback loop, you can try these steps while in an [SSH session](/docs/ssh-access-to-build-environment.html).
