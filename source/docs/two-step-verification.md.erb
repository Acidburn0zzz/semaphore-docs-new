Two-step verification secures your account by requiring a one time password, in
addition to your username and password, to access your account. This ensures
that your account stays secured even if your password is compromised.


### Turn on 2-Step Verification

Go to your [account settings](https://semaphoreci.com/users/edit) page and then
in the 2-Step Verification section, click on "Enable". On the next screen, you
can choose the authenticator app for your phone and install it.

With an authenticator app, you scan a barcode code, and the app connects with
the Semaphore website to verify itself. It then displays a six-digit code,
which you have to enter in a limited amount of time. When the time runs out,
the app will generate a new code. Once you verify code successfully, two step
verification is turned on for your account.

### How to recover if you lose access to your phone

Once you turn on two-step verification, Semaphore generates the recovery codes
for you. You can download them [here](https://semaphoreci.com/users/two_step_verification/recovery_codes). If you lose acess to your phone,
you can still complete the second step of verification using a recovery code.

To verify using recovery code, click "Use backup recovery codes" during two-step
verification process. It will ask you to authenticate using the recovery code.

### How to Turn Off 2-Step Verification

Go to your [account settings](https://semaphoreci.com/users/edit) and then in the
2-Step Verification section, click on "Disable". You will be asked to enter
verification code generated through the authenticator app and then select
"Disable 2-step verification".
