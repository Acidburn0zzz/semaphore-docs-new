Two-step verification secures your account by requiring a one-time password, in
addition to your username and password, to access your account. This ensures
that your account stays secured even if your password is compromised.


### Turn on 2-step verification

Go to your [account settings](https://semaphoreci.com/users/edit) page and click
on "Enable" in the 2-Step Verification section. On the following screen, you
can choose the authenticator app for your phone and install it.

With an authenticator app, you scan a barcode, and the app connects with
the Semaphore website to verify itself. It then displays a six-digit code,
which you will need to enter within a limited time frame. When the time runs out,
the app will generate a new code. Once you have successfully verified the code,
two step verification will be turned on for your account.

### What to do if you lose access to your phone

Once you turn on two-step verification, Semaphore will generate the recovery codes
for you. You can download them [here](https://semaphoreci.com/users/two_step_verification/recovery_codes). If you lose acess to your phone,
you can still complete the second step of verification using a recovery code.

To verify using recovery code, click "Use backup recovery codes" during the two-step
verification process. It will ask you to authenticate using the recovery code.

### How to turn off 2-step verification

Go to your [account settings](https://semaphoreci.com/users/edit) and click on
"Disable" in the 2-Step Verification section. You will be asked to enter the
verification code generated through the authenticator app, and then select
"Disable 2-step verification". Don't worry if you lost you access to authenticator app,
you can also disable 2-Step Verification using recovery codes. Just follow "Use backup recovery codes", 
enter recovery code and 2-Step Verification will be disabled.
