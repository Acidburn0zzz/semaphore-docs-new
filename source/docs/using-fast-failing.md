title: Using Fast Failing
category: Adapting Semaphore to your workflow
---

On Semaphore, fast failing means that you get instant feedback when a job fails.
All the running jobs of a build are stopped as soon as one of the jobs fails.
This means that you donâ€™t need to wait for all the other jobs to finish in order
to get build feedback.

You can select the type of fast failing in the branch settings of your project.
You can either enable it for all branches, or for all branches except the
default one.
