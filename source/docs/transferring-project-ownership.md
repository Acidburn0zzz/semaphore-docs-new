Semaphore doesn't support transferring projects between user accounts for
security reasons.

Semaphore does support [organization
accounts](/docs/organizations/what-is-the-difference-between-a-user-account-and-an-organization.html)
that enable sharing project ownership with with a group of users and advanced
project access management. An organization can have multiple owners and project
administrators. Ownership of an organization can be [transferred between
users](/docs/organizations/transferring-organization-ownership.html).
