title: Removing a user from multiple teams in your organization
category: Organizations
---

Teams allow organization owners to grant, remove and manage user access to
projects in an organization. If a user in your team no longer requires access
to certain projects, you can remove them from the teams that provide them
access to these projects.

##Removing a user from multiple teams

Only users who are in the _Owners_ team can remove other users from teams in
an organization.

The only way to remove a user from multiple projects at once is to [remove the
user from the organization](/docs/organizations/removing-a-user-from-your-organization.html),
in which case they will lose access to all projects in your organization.

If you need to remove a user from only certain specific teams, you will need to
[manually remove the user from each team ](/docs/organizations/removing-a-user-from-a-team-in-your-organization.html) 
they no longer require access to.
