Teams allow organization owners to grant, remove and manage user access to
projects in an organization. If a user in your team no longer requires access
to certain projects, you can remove them from the team that provides them
access to these projects.

##Removing a user from a team

Only users who are in the _Owners_ team can remove other users from a team in
an organization. In order to remove a user from a team, you need to:

1. Go to your **Account** in the main menu.
