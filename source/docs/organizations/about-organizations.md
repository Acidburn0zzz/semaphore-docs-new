Organizations are Semaphore's account management framework that lets you grant
different permissions to team members and delegate project management under
a single account. Every user can create and be part of any number of organizations.

Features of organizations include:

- [Shared project and billing management](/docs/organizations/granting-users-permission-to-manage-projects-within-an-organization.html)
- [Different permission levels](/docs/organizations/permission-levels-in-an-organization.html)
- [Teams with access to different projects](/docs/organizations/creating-a-team.html)
- Paid plans for up to 128 [parallel jobs](/docs/running-tests-in-parallel.html),
  or an open source plan with 2 paralle jobs.
