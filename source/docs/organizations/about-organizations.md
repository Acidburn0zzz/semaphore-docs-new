Organizations are Semaphore's account management framework that lets you grant
different permissions to team members and delegate project management under
a single account. Every user can create and be part of any number of organizations.

##Features of organizations include:

- [Shared project and billing management](/docs/organizations/granting-users-permission-to-manage-projects-within-an-organization.html)
- [Different permission levels](/docs/organizations/permission-levels-in-an-organization.html)
- [Teams with access to different projects](/docs/organizations/creating-a-team.html)
- Paid plans for up to 128 [parallel jobs](/docs/running-tests-in-parallel.html),
  or an open source plan with 4 parallel jobs.
- [Activity monitor](/docs/activity-monitor.html), a feature that helps you easily
  identify running and waiting processes on  Semaphore.
- [Secrets](/docs/secrets.html), a feature that lets you share environment variables
  and configuration files across projects within an organization.
