Organizations are a great option for large teams and open-source projects that
require multiple project owners and different permission levels for
collaborators on their projects.

Organizations include:
- [Shared project and billing management](/docs/organizations/granting-users-permission-to-manage-projects-within-an-organization.html)
- [Different permission levels](/docs/organizations/permission-levels-in-an-organization.html)
- [Teams with access to different projects](/docs/organizations/creating-a-team.html)
- Up to 32 [parallel build threads](/docs/running-tests-in-parallel.html)
