category: Organizations

Organizations differ from user accounts.  A **user account** allows you to
create projects and invite collaborators.

On the other hand, **organizations** are perfect for businesses and teams which
have the need to be able to allow more than one user to manage their projects,
or who would like to be able to give different permissions to different teams
and/or collaborators.

## Next steps

you can take:

- Grant other users permission to manage projects
