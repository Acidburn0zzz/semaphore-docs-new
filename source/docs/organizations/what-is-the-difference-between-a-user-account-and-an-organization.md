title: What is the difference between a user account and an organization?
category: Organizations
---

Organizations differ from user accounts. A user account is an account created
and used by a single person, while an organization is a group that one or more
users can own and manage.

A **user account** allows you to create open source projects and invite
collaborators. On the other hand, **organizations** allow you to create both
private and open source projects, and are used by businesses and teams which
have the need to be able to allow more than one user to manage their projects,
or to set different permission levels for different teams and/or collaborators.
Also, organizations include features like [Activity monitor](/docs/activity-monitor.html)
and [Secrets](/docs/secrets.html).
