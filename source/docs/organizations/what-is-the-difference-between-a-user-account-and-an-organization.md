title: What is the difference between a user account and an organization?
category: Organizations
---

Organizations differ from user accounts. A user account is an
account created and used by a single person, while an organization is a group
that one or more users can own and manage.

A **user account** allows you to create projects and invite collaborators. On
the other hand, **organizations** are used by businesses and teams which
have the need to be able to allow more than one user to manage their projects,
or to set different permission levels for different teams and/or collaborators.

## Next steps

If you are interested in creating an organization, here are the next steps
you can take:

- Set up an organization
- Create teams with different permissions
- Grant other users permission to manage projects
