title: Assigning different roles to collaborators on a project
category: Organizations
---

Once you have [set up an organization](/docs/organizations/setting-up-an-organization.html),
you can assign members of your team different roles with different project
access levels.

In order to be able to assign different roles to your collaborators, you need
to be included in the Owners team of your Semaphore organization. Owners can
create teams, and then change their permissions for all projects.

##Assigning roles

In order to assign a role to a user or a group of users in your organization,
you first need to create a team for each role by [following these steps](/docs/organizations/creating-a-team.html).

Once you have created different teams, you can change their permissions:

1. Click on **Account** next to your username in the main menu.

to manage.

organization page.

You can also change a user's role by adding them to an existing team with the
desired role and permissions.
