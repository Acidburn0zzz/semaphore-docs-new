Organizations enable businesses and teams to give different permissions to their team members and have multiple project owners.

## Creating a new organization

Creating a new organization is very easy and cheap to do. You will be offered
to create an organization when [adding a private project to Semaphore](/adding-github-bitbucket-project-to-semahore).

You can also easily create an organization from your navigation.

1. In the navigation click "Create new" and choose "Organization"

2. Enter organization name. Semaphore will check if that name is taken already
   whilst you type.

   By creating an organization you will get a **free 30-day trial** with up to
   **8 parallel jobs**. After 30 days of free trial you will be switched to
   free plan, which allows you unlimited builds for open source projects and
   100 jobs per month for private projects.
