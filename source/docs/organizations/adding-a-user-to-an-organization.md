Once you have created an organization, you can add users and grant them access
to different projects, as well as give them different permissions. To add a user
 to an organization, you need to add them to an existing team, or
[create a new team within that organization](/docs/organizations/creating-a-team.html).

##Adding a user to a team

Only users who are in the _Owners_ team can add other users to different teams.
In order to add a user to a team, you need to:

1. Go to your **Account** in the main menu.

2. Click on the **Organizations** tab and select the organization you would like
to manage.

3. On the left side of your organization page, under _Manage Organization_,
click on **Teams**.

4. Click on the team name.

5. Add the user to the team by searching for them by their username
or the email address in the _Invite by username or email_ field.

If you invite a new user who does not have an existing Semaphore account by
email, they will need to accept the invitation before becoming a member of the
organization.
