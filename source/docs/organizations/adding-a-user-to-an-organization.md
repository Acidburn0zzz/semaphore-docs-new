Once you have created an organization, you can add users and grant them access
to different projects. To add an user to an organization, you need to add them
to an existing team, or
[create a new team within that organization](/docs/organizations/creating-a-team.html).

##Adding a user to a team

Only users who in the _Owners_ team can add other users to different teams. In
order to add a user to a team, you need to:

1. Go to your **Account** in the main menu.

to manage.

click on **Teams**.

5. Add the user to the team by searching for them by their username
or the email address in the _Invite by username or email_ field.

 If you invite the new user by email, they will need to accept the invitation
 before becoming a member of the organization.
