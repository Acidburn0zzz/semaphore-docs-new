Creating an organization is a simple way to enable teams to have multiple
project owners. In order to grant a user the permission to manage your
organization's projects, you need to add him to the _Owners_ team.

##Adding a user to the "Owners" team

Only users who are already in the _Owners_ team can add other users to this
team. In order to add a user to this team, you need to:

1. Go to your **Account** in the main menu.

to manage.

click on **Teams**.

or the email address in the _Invite by username or email_ field.
