You can transfer the ownership of your Semaphore organization to other members
by adding them to the _Owners_ team.

##How to transfer organization ownership

Transferring your organization to another user is simple:

1. If you are the only member of the _Owners_ team, you first need to [add
another user to the team](/docs/organizations/granting-users-permission-to-manage-projects-within-an-organization.html).

2. If you no longer require access to the organization, you can [remove yourself
from the organization](/docs/organizations/removing-a-user-from-your-organization.html).
However, since the projects you have added to the organization are connected to
GitHub through your user account, you will not be able to leave the organization
if there are some active projects you have added in the organization.
