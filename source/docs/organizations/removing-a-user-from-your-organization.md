If a user in your organization no longer requires access to any of the projects
they have been given access to, you can remove them from the organization.

##How to remove a user from an organization

Only users who are in the _Owners_ team can remove other users from an
organization. In order to remove a user from your organization, you need to:

1. Go to your **Account** in the main menu.
