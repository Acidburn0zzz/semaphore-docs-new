Semaphore organizations make it easy for you to give different permissions to
the members of your team.

In order to be able to limit the permissions certain users have on a project,
you need to be included in the Owners team of your Semaphore organization.
Owners can [create teams](/docs/organizations/creating-a-team.html), and then
change their permissions for all projects.

##Changing team permissions

To change a team's permissions, you need to take the following steps:

1. Click on **Account** next to your username in the main menu.

You can also change a user's permissions by adding them to an existing team with
the desired permissions.
