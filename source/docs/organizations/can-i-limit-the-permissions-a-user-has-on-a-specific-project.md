Semaphore organizations make it easy for you to give different permissions to
the members of your team.

In order to be able to limit the permissions certain users have on a project,
you need to be included in the Owners team of your Semaphore organization.
Owners can create teams, and then change their permissions for all projects.

##Creating a team

If the user(s) whose permissions you would like to change is already in a team,
skip this section and go to **Changing team permissions** below.

1. Click on **Account** next to your username in the main menu.
