title: Set high priority branches
category: Customizing your build
---

With high priority branches you can choose one or more branches that will be
scheduled before others. They can be specified with a list of regular
expressions. For example:

```
hotfix-.*
master
```

will match hotfix-start-build and master as high priority branches.

We recommend setting only one or two branches as high priority since adding more
can make the algorithm insignificant.

Youâ€™ll find the screen to configure this in your project settings, Branches tab.
