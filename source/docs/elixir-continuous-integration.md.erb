Semaphore provides Elixir through [kiex](https://github.com/taylor/kiex), which
enables you to manage multiple versions of the Elixir language.

Our stack comes with Elixir version <%= package_version("elixir") %>.

List of all packages and versions is available on the
[supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
