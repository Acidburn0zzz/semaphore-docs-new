Important packages that are available in the platform are listed in the [Supported application stack](/supported-stack) article.

Additional dependencies can be added by simply adding an installation command to your build settings:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libawesome-dev
```

If you need help, just [email us](mailto:semaphore@renderedtext.com) with your needs. If not, we’d still love to hear from you – knowing that many people are using a particular dependency generally encourages us to add it to platform.
