After you click on your profile photo, from the drop-down menu choose the organization you'd like to update the mailing address for. On the left side of your organization page open "Subscription" > "Update payment method". You’ll be redirected to the Semaphore CI Store where you’ll be able to see the subscription details. Afterwards, click on "Edit subscription" > "Update address"
