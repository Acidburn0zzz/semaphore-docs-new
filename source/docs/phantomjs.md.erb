Semaphore supports the following versions of PhantomJS:

<% package_versions("phantomjs").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Switching between PhantomJS versions is done by adding the following command
to your build commands:

`change-phantomjs-version <version>`

Valid values for `<version>` are `1.9.8` and `2.0.0`. The default PhantomJS
version is `1.9.8`.
