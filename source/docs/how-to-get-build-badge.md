Semaphore features nice looking embeddable badges that you can add to a
project's Readme, homepage or other places to make the project build status more
visible to developers, contributors and users.

You can choose between Semaphore and [Shields](http://shields.io/) style badge.

Semaphore provides badge embed codes for Markdown, HTML and Textile, as well as
a direct link to a PNG image. To copy the code for your project, go to Project
Settings > Badge tab.

Once you have set up your badge, its image will always automatically represent
the current status of your build.
