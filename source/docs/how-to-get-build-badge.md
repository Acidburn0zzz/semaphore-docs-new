Semaphore features nice looking embeddable badges that you can add to a
project's Readme, homepage or other places to make the project build status more
accessible for developers and users.

You can choose between a Semaphore style and generic [Shields](http://shields.io/) style badge.

Head to the Badge section of the project settings to find the embeddable code,
available in different flavors: Markdown, HTML, Textile and direct link to a
PNG.
