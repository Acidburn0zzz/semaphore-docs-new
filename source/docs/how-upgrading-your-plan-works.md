title: How upgrading your plan works?
category: Billing

If you decide to upgrade (or downgrade) your current subscription plan, this change
will be effective immediately. You don't have to wait for your current subscription
period to end in order to take a different one. This rule applies to both monthly
and annual plans.  If you change subscription plan in the middle of the subscription
period, this will initiate a prorated upgrade â€” you will be charged based on the
number of days remaining before your subscription renewal, and you'll receive a
refund for the unused portion of your original plan.

__Note:__
Our annual plans are non-refundable and cannot be downgraded until the original
subscription period expires.
