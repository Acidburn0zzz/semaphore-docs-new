In order to be able to delete an account you must:

1. [Delete all projects](/docs/organizations/deleting-a-project.html) you created or change the user-project association. User-projects
association can be changed by a member of the Owners team and the one needs to re-select
repository by following [these steps](/docs/repository-settings.html#switching-repository).

another user](/docs/organizations/adding-a-user-to-an-organization.html) to the Owners team if you don't want to delete an organization.

After the above mentioned conditions are met, you should follow these steps:

1. Click on your Avatar in the top right corner of the page and go to **Settings**.
2. At the bottom of the **Account setting** page click on **Need to cancel?**
3. Click on **Delete My Account**.
