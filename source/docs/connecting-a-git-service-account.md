Semaphore currently supports GitHub and Bitbucket. To connect your account to
your GitHub or Bitbucket account, follow these steps:

First, go to the Git Services tab on the account page.
Click on the appropriate button to connect your Semaphore account to your
GitHub or Bitbucket account. For the purposes of this guide we will choose
GitHub.

If you're connecting to Bitbucket, this step is skipped since Bitbucket doesn't 
support scopes. If not, choose the scope of the projects you want to add to
Semaphore.

After you authorize Semaphore to acces your account on your chosen Git service,
you should see that Semaphore has a working connection.

You now have successfully connected your Semaphore account to GitHub. You
can follow the same steps again to connect to Bitbucket.
