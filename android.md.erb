While there is no out of the box support for Android development on Semaphore, some components for Android development are readily available. Among others, Semaphore fully supports [C/C++](docs/c-continuous-integration.html) and [Java](docs/java-continuous-integration.html) languages without requiring any installation.

If you need anything, which is not included in the boxes, feel free to install and download the needed libraries and tools. The environment grants `sudo` access for this by default.
